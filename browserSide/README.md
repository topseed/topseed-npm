# Setup

When using .js in front end creation or development, some pattern implementations are commonly useful. This is ~450 bytes .js file used by topseed projects and we are always looking for things to remove from here. 

You can use it also.


Features:

- fetch() helper, as XHR and Ajax are superceded. (using API is Cloud v2)

- working w/ SPA (ex: smoothstate.com )

Above 2 allow for cross platform native mobile ( one example is cordova or build.phonegap.com)

- working with JWT and basic auth

- observer pattern, aka listener, dispatcher, events, and loosely coupled ( http://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals/wiki/Comparison-between-different-Observer-Pattern-implementations )

- practical derivative implementation of Flux

- framework agnostic

- depends on muicss/loadjs

- loads and uses js-cookie from CDN

- loads latest jQuery v3.x


Version naming is YY.MM.DD
